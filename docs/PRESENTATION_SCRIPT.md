### **Slide 3: The Problem (Why We Fail)**
*(Click to Slide 3)*
"But Maya has a problem. Actually, she has three."
1.  **Invisible Impact:** "She asks, 'Does my recycling actually matter?' She feels like a drop in the ocean."
2.  **Trust Deficit:** "She sees companies 'greenwashing' and doesn't trust the claims."
3.  **Isolation:** "Fighting climate change feels lonely."

"This is why 70% of people lose motivation to live sustainably within two weeks. The feedback loop is broken."

## ❓ Potential Q&A Prep

**Q: How do you prevent people from taking photos of the same bottle twice?**
**A:** "Great question. We use image hashing to detect duplicates, and we also use metadata (GPS and timestamp) to ensure the action is unique and recent."

**Q: Why Solana?**
**A:** "Speed and Cost. Ethereum is too slow and expensive for a consumer app where you might mint an NFT every day. Solana's Compressed NFTs allow us to mint millions of assets for pennies."

**Q: How do you make money?**
**A:** "Primarily through our Marketplace (transaction fees) and B2B Corporate Partnerships where companies pay us to run 'Green Challenges' for their employees."
